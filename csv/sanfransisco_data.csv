Airbnb’s mission is to connect people to unique travel experiences, in more than 34,000 cities and 190 Countries. We are making it possible for hosts to supplement their income while helping visitors from around the world experience neighborhoods and communities outside traditional tourist zones.

Here at Airbnb, we’re big fans of travel. We love thinking about the diversity of experiences our host community offers, and we spend a fair amount of time trying to make sense of the tens of thousands of cities where people are booking trips every night. The tricky thing is, most of us haven’t been to Cuba, so we try to come up with creative ways to help people find the experience they’re looking for in places they may have never been. The data science team works in tandem with product management, engineering, and design teams to solve for things like this.

Some areas of responsibility include:

Analysis:
Deep dive analysis into Airbnb’s vast data to uncover opportunities.
Partner with data scientists and analysts to help “tell the story” behind the data.
Product Strategy:
Partnering with leadership to prioritize areas of opportunity to drive growth/quality.
Evaluate and define product and business metrics.
Product Execution:
Communicate state of the business to stakeholders.
Digest and interpret experiments.
Decision Tools:
Democratize data by building and socializing decision tools (dashboards, reports).
Build key data sets/pipelines to empower operational and exploratory analysis.

The tricky thing is, most of us haven’t been to Cuba, so we try to come up with creative ways to help people find the experience they’re looking for in places they may have never been. The data science team works in tandem with product management, engineering, and design teams to solve for things like this.

Some areas of responsibility include:

Analysis:
Deep dive analysis into Airbnb’s vast data to uncover opportunities.
Partner with data scientists and analysts to help “tell the story” behind the data.
Product Strategy:
Partnering with leadership to prioritize areas of opportunity to drive growth/quality.
Evaluate and define product and business metrics.
Product Execution:
Communicate state of the business to stakeholders.
Digest and interpret experiments.
Decision Tools:
Democratize data by building and socializing decision tools (dashboards, reports).
Build key data sets/pipelines to empower operational and exploratory analysis.
Qualifications:

Pursuing a PhD, MS or BS in CS, Math, Statistics, Physics, Economics or other quantitative field with an expected graduation date of Summer 2018.
Ability to think and execute at multiple altitudes: from strategy and vision to execution.
Interpersonal skills with demonstrated ability to influence outcomes and communicate technical content to general audiences, including ability to “story tell” with data.
Ability to write and mentor code development in SQL and Python (or R).
Experience with dashboard design and data viz tools (i.e. Tableau) is a plus
Experience with building data pipelines is a plus.

Trianz ,$144k-$164k(Glassdoor Est.),3.9,"Airbnb has become a global platform that connects travelers and hosts from over 81,000 cities. Our Data Science team draws insights from our rich two sided marketplace data to propel our community and product forward. Together we can create a place where we can belong anywhere.

Airbnb is a fast-growing company, nearly doubling our workforce in the past two years. Such dynamic growth raises important questions, including how to identify the best recruiting strategies; how to keep employees engaged and happy; how to hire, promote, and retain a demographically diverse workforce; and how to maintain our unique culture while scaling rapidly. While we have a lot of data to bring to bear, information is only as valuable as it is understood by decision-makers. We are looking for a talented analyst who can work cross-functionally with Data Scientists and HR business partners to translate insights to action.

The ideal candidate has an eye for detail, great communication, and a keenness for problem solving, as well as significant experience in recruiting and/or talent management. Examples of projects you would work on include, but are not limited to, creating business-critical dashboards, defining key metrics, and investigating challenging questions around employee attitudes and behavior. Working alongside Data Scientists who dig deep into Airbnb's data, you will help them translate complex findings and results into a compelling narrative. In this role, you will have tremendous upwards exposure as the Data Science team’s mouthpiece to senior business partners. If you’re passionate about leveraging data to drive business decisions, we want to hear from you.

Responsibilities include:
Ownership: conceptualize, create, and maintain monitoring dashboards for tracking key metrics
Communication: design and draft regular reports of progress towards company goals to product groups and senior stakeholders
Creativity: refine and improve definition of metrics as the company’s challenges and data evolve
Engineering: collaborate with data engineers to better log data and manage the timeliness and accessibility of data tables
Investigation: carry out ad hoc descriptive analysis according to business needs
Empowerment: strategize on making analyses easily repeatable and generalizable by other team members in the future
Qualities we value:
Professional industry experience in a quantitative analysis role (4+ years preferred)
Comfortable in SQL and some experience with a programming language, with Python or R a plus
Ability to communicate clearly and effectively to cross functional partners of varying technical levels
Ability to define relevant metrics that can guide and influence stakeholders to the appropriate and accurate insights
Experience or willingness to learn tools to create data pipelines using Airflow

Instacart ,$187k-$258k(Glassdoor Est.),3.9,"Airbnb has become a global platform that connects travelers and hosts from over 81,000 cities. Our Data Science team draws insights from our rich two sided marketplace data to propel our community and product forward. Together we can create a place where we can belong anywhere.

Airbnb is a fast-growing company, nearly doubling our workforce in the past two years. Such dynamic growth raises important questions, including how to identify the best recruiting strategies; how to keep employees engaged and happy; how to hire, promote, and retain a demographically diverse workforce; and how to maintain our unique culture while scaling rapidly. While we have a lot of data to bring to bear, information is only as valuable as it is understood by decision-makers. We are looking for a talented analyst who can work cross-functionally with Data Scientists and HR business partners to translate insights to action.

The ideal candidate has an eye for detail, great communication, and a keenness for problem solving, as well as significant experience in recruiting and/or talent management. Examples of projects you would work on include, but are not limited to, creating business-critical dashboards, defining key metrics, and investigating challenging questions around employee attitudes and behavior. Working alongside Data Scientists who dig deep into Airbnb's data, you will help them translate complex findings and results into a compelling narrative. In this role, you will have tremendous upwards exposure as the Data Science team’s mouthpiece to senior business partners. If you’re passionate about leveraging data to drive business decisions, we want to hear from you.

Responsibilities include:
Ownership: conceptualize, create, and maintain monitoring dashboards for tracking key metrics
Communication: design and draft regular reports of progress towards company goals to product groups and senior stakeholders
Creativity: refine and improve definition of metrics as the company’s challenges and data evolve
Engineering: collaborate with data engineers to better log data and manage the timeliness and accessibility of data tables
Investigation: carry out ad hoc descriptive analysis according to business needs
Empowerment: strategize on making analyses easily repeatable and generalizable by other team members in the future
Qualities we value:
Professional industry experience in a quantitative analysis role (4+ years preferred)
Comfortable in SQL and some experience with a programming language, with Python or R a plus
Ability to communicate clearly and effectively to cross functional partners of varying technical levels
Ability to define relevant metrics that can guide and influence stakeholders to the appropriate and accurate insights
Experience or willingness to learn tools to create data pipelines using Airflow

Airbnb’s mission is to connect people to unique travel experiences, in more than 34,000 cities and 190 Countries. We are making it possible for hosts to supplement their income while helping visitors from around the world experience neighborhoods and communities outside traditional tourist zones.

Here at Airbnb, we’re big fans of travel. We love thinking about the diversity of experiences our host community offers, and we spend a fair amount of time trying to make sense of the tens of thousands of cities where people are booking trips every night. The tricky thing is, most of us haven’t been to Cuba, so we try to come up with creative ways to help people find the experience they’re looking for in places they may have never been.

Scoops engineering team may move bits and pixels, but we also put real, live human beings in cars together. Were touching problems academics have written about for years, and have data that no other company has ever collected.

But Scoop knows engineering is not a lone discipline. Were a small team with varied backgrounds: big companies, VC-backed startups, bootcamps, academia. We like to build together, and we like to learn together. Our entire team and process are built around helping you grow and be successful. And wed love to tell you more about the impact you could have at Scoop.

Since then, our network has grown to three countries, 45 cities and over 140,000 Taskers, yet our core mission has remained the same. We want to make everyday life easier for everyday people. And by doing that, we can make your neighborhood a little more familiar.

In 2017, TaskRabbit launched TaskRabbit for Good (TR4G), which connects neighbors to build sustainable and compassionate communities. TaskRabbit for Good was created to make it easier for neighbors to give back locally and make a positive impact in communities around the world. TaskRabbit donates a portion of its service fee from all TR4G initiatives to best-in-class local non-profit organizations tackling social and environmental challenges.

TaskRabbit's headquarters is located in the heart of San Francisco, with three other offices in New York City, Austin, and London.

Company Overview:

TaskRabbit is a task management network that conveniently connects people with Taskers to handle everyday home to-do's, such as furniture assembly, handyman work, moving help, and much more. Acquired by IKEA Group - the world's largest furniture retailer - in 2017, TaskRabbit operates in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada and is expanding its global reach rapidly.

As a pioneer of the sharing economy, TaskRabbit was founded in 2008 on the premise of neighbors helping neighbors. Since then, our network has grown to three countries, 45 cities and over 140,000 Taskers, yet our core mission has remained the same. We want to make everyday life easier for everyday people. And by doing that, we can make your neighborhood a little more familiar.

In 2017, TaskRabbit launched TaskRabbit for Good (TR4G), which connects neighbors to build sustainable and compassionate communities. TaskRabbit for Good was created to make it easier for neighbors to give back locally and make a positive impact in communities around the world. TaskRabbit donates a portion of its service fee from all TR4G initiatives to best-in-class local non-profit organizations tackling social and environmental challenges.

TaskRabbit's headquarters is located in the heart of San Francisco, with three other offices in New York City, Austin, and London.

Company Overview:

TaskRabbit is a task management network that conveniently connects people with Taskers to handle everyday home to-do's, such as furniture assembly, handyman work, moving help, and much more. Acquired by IKEA Group - the world's largest furniture retailer - in 2017, TaskRabbit operates in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada and is expanding its global reach rapidly.

As a pioneer of the sharing economy, TaskRabbit was founded in 2008 on the premise of neighbors helping neighbors. Since then, our network has grown to three countries, 45 cities and over 140,000 Taskers, yet our core mission has remained the same. We want to make everyday life easier for everyday people. And by doing that, we can make your neighborhood a little more familiar.

In 2017, TaskRabbit launched TaskRabbit for Good (TR4G), which connects neighbors to build sustainable and compassionate communities. TaskRabbit for Good was created to make it easier for neighbors to give back locally and make a positive impact in communities around the world. TaskRabbit donates a portion of its service fee from all TR4G initiatives to best-in-class local non-profit organizations tackling social and environmental challenges.

TaskRabbit's headquarters is located in the heart of San Francisco, with three other offices in New York City, Austin, and London.

As a pioneer of the sharing economy, TaskRabbit was founded on the premise of neighbors helping neighbors. Since then, our network has grown to three countries and 45+ cities, yet our core mission of creating a better everyday life for everyday people has remained the same.

You will also assist in defining metrics and building dynamic reports that business unit managers can use to track progress towards targets.

Data Platform Engineering builds distributed components, systems, and tools that power decisions at Airbnb. No other travel service participates so broadly in the travel experience from discovery, to booking, to crafting experiences during the stay, and assessing quality of trips. This gives us an incredibly rich dataset to collect, transform, and analyze in order to improve the effectiveness of our marketplace and create delight for guests and hosts.

We leverage existing open source technologies like Kafka, Hadoop, Hive, Presto, Spark, and also write our own. Many projects listed below have been open sourced. As a member of our team you would spend time designing and growing our existing infrastructure, democratizing data access at the company, and promoting the correct use of data and analytics at the company.

What are examples of work that Data Platform Engineers have done at Airbnb?
Real-time streaming infrastructure: To enable teams to move quickly, getting accurate data with minimal delay is a core focus in DI. Currently, we are building out Spark-based infrastructure to allow for easy development of streaming applications.
Interactive dimensional analysis: Data scientists have a strong need to query data and compute aggregates on various dimensional cuts. To address this, we are building a query tool based on Druid to allow users to interactively slice-and-dice large datasets.
Cluster management systems: To help manage multiple petabyte-scale clusters, easy-to-use systems to handle security, disaster recovery, and replication are in development. For replication, we have developed and open sourced ReAir
Data workflow management: Started at Airbnb, Airflow is a system that enables users to schedule data-related workflows with a code-as-configuration model and web front end.
Machine learning infrastructure: Many products at Airbnb rely on machine learning (ML) to achieve their goals. A common infrastructure for ML can save significant development time for the company.
The following experience is relevant to us:
2+ years of full-time, industry experience
Working with data at the petabyte scale
Design and operation of robust distributed systems
Experience with Java / Scala is preferred
Strong scripting ability in Ruby / Python / Bash
Working knowledge of relational databases and query authoring (SQL)

Data Platform Engineering builds distributed components, systems, and tools that power decisions at Airbnb. No other travel service participates so broadly in the travel experience from discovery, to booking, to crafting experiences during the stay, and assessing quality of trips. This gives us an incredibly rich dataset to collect, transform, and analyze in order to improve the effectiveness of our marketplace and create delight for guests and hosts.

We leverage existing open source technologies like Kafka, Hadoop, Hive, Presto, Spark, and also write our own. Many projects listed below have been open sourced. As a member of our team you would spend time designing and growing our existing infrastructure, democratizing data access at the company, and promoting the correct use of data and analytics at the company.

What are examples of work that Data Platform Engineers have done at Airbnb?
Real-time streaming infrastructure: To enable teams to move quickly, getting accurate data with minimal delay is a core focus in DI. Currently, we are building out Spark-based infrastructure to allow for easy development of streaming applications.
Interactive dimensional analysis: Data scientists have a strong need to query data and compute aggregates on various dimensional cuts. To address this, we are building a query tool based on Druid to allow users to interactively slice-and-dice large datasets.
Cluster management systems: To help manage multiple petabyte-scale clusters, easy-to-use systems to handle security, disaster recovery, and replication are in development. For replication, we have developed and open sourced ReAir
