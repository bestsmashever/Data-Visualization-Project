How to Apply

Description
As a Data Engineer for the CIA, you will focus on the design, implementation, and operation of data management systems to meet the CIA's business needs. This includes designing how the data will be stored, consumed, integrated, and managed by different data entities and digital systems. Data Engineers work together with data consumers to determine, create, and populate optimal data architectures, structures, and systems.

Data Engineers must also plan, design, and optimize for data throughput and query performance issues. This requires constantly updating expertise in areas such as platform, network and storage technologies, bandwidth management, data bus implications, and design.

Additionally, you will play a key role in the selection of backend database technologies (SQL, NoSQL, HPC, etc), their configuration and utilization, and the optimization of the full data pipeline infrastructure to support the actual content, volume, ETL, and periodicity of data to support the intended kinds of queries and analysis to match expected responsiveness.
