We are open to working with you on a salary (W-2) or contract (1099 or Corp to Corp)

Must have 7+ years of work experience.
For Data Scientists
1. At least 3 years working on a product powered by machine learning technology. Must have owned a critical part of it. Ideally, these are folks from Uber, Pinterest, Google, Facebook, AI startups, Microsoft and other cutting-edge companies.
2. Graduate degree in computer science, statistics, or applied mathematics or the equivalent.
3. Ph. D. in Non-CS degree paired with intensive boot camp and experience.
We are not interested in:
folks with degrees like Information Technology who want to be scientists
Folks with a professional history of success.
Contractors
For data engineers
3+ Years working on large-scale applications, such as at Google, Facebook, etc, that are powered by Machine learning.
Experience with machine learning and A/B testing, but not necessarily expert at it.
Strong JS/Node and/or Python
Not looking for:
People who've done nothing but run pipeline tech (Kafka, Hadoop, spark, etc.). Need to be competent full stack developers.

THE ROLE
We're expanding our fleet of vehicles that can autonomously prepare food in-transit. We've proven that we can do it so now we're going to scale it to all prepared food.
The problem we need to solve is a combination of Uber's ride scheduling problem with Amazon's autonomous supply chain problem and Doordash’s last mile delivery, but to make things more tricky food needs to show up freshly prepared, so timing is critical. And that just the tip of the iceberg of where we're going. To scale we're going to need to solve lots of really hard problems that call for a world-class data science team. That’s where you come in.
You should have a broad understanding of data science in general, but we're also looking for specialists in at least one of (convex) optimization, stochastic processes, time series, and machine learning. Graduate work in any of these fields is a plus. You'll need to be proficient in programming (python), and not afraid to get your hands dirty in implementation. Experience with hardware a plus, but not required.
This is a rare opportunity to get in at the early stages of a growing team, in a rapidly growing company. We're looking for one of the next leaders in the industry. If that’s you, let's talk.

THE ROLE
We're expanding our fleet of vehicles that can autonomously prepare food in-transit. We've proven that we can do it so now we're going to scale it to all prepared food.
The problem we need to solve is a combination of Uber's ride scheduling problem with Amazon's autonomous supply chain problem and Doordash’s last mile delivery, but to make things more tricky food needs to show up freshly prepared, so timing is critical. And that just the tip of the iceberg of where we're going. To scale we're going to need to solve lots of really hard problems that call for a world-class data science team. That’s where you come in.
You should have a broad understanding of data science in general, but we're also looking for specialists in at least one of (convex) optimization, stochastic processes, time series, and machine learning. Graduate work in any of these fields is a plus. You'll need to be proficient in programming (python), and not afraid to get your hands dirty in implementation. Experience with hardware a plus, but not required.
This is a rare opportunity to get in at the early stages of a growing team, in a rapidly growing company. We're looking for one of the next leaders in the industry. If that’s you, let's talk.
WHO YOU ARE
A generalist in data science with deeper experience in either Optimization, Stochastic Processes, Deep Learning or reinforcement learning.
Degree CS, Applied Math, Statistics, or other scientific fields. Graduate degree a plus
Experience building models on real-world problems
Software development experience in python

Seattle WA
San Jose CA
We are open to working with you on a salary (W-2) or contract (1099 or Corp to Corp)

Must have 7+ years of work experience.
For Data Scientists
1. At least 3 years working on a product powered by machine learning technology. Must have owned a critical part of it. Ideally, these are folks from Uber, Pinterest, Google, Facebook, AI startups, Microsoft and other cutting-edge companies.
2. Graduate degree in computer science, statistics, or applied mathematics or the equivalent.
3. Ph. D. in Non-CS degree paired with intensive boot camp and experience.
We are not interested in:
folks with degrees like Information Technology who want to be scientists
Folks with a professional history of success.
Contractors
For data engineers
3+ Years working on large-scale applications, such as at Google, Facebook, etc, that are powered by Machine learning.
Experience with machine learning and A/B testing, but not necessarily expert at it.
Strong JS/Node and/or Python
Not looking for:
People who've done nothing but run pipeline tech (Kafka, Hadoop, spark, etc.). Need to be competent full stack developers.

THE ROLE
We're expanding our fleet of vehicles that can autonomously prepare food in-transit. We've proven that we can do it so now we're going to scale it to all prepared food.
The problem we need to solve is a combination of Uber's ride scheduling problem with Amazon's autonomous supply chain problem and Doordash’s last mile delivery, but to make things more tricky food needs to show up freshly prepared, so timing is critical. And that just the tip of the iceberg of where we're going. To scale we're going to need to solve lots of really hard problems that call for a world-class data science team. That’s where you come in.
You should have a broad understanding of data science in general, but we're also looking for specialists in at least one of (convex) optimization, stochastic processes, time series, and machine learning. Graduate work in any of these fields is a plus. You'll need to be proficient in programming (python), and not afraid to get your hands dirty in implementation. Experience with hardware a plus, but not required.
This is a rare opportunity to get in at the early stages of a growing team, in a rapidly growing company. We're looking for one of the next leaders in the industry. If that’s you, let's talk.
WHO YOU ARE
A generalist in data science with deeper experience in either Optimization, Stochastic Processes, Deep Learning or reinforcement learning.
Degree CS, Applied Math, Statistics, or other scientific fields. Graduate degree a plus
Experience building models on real-world problems
Software development experience in python
BONUS POINTS
Familiarity with hardware/robotics
Understanding of supply chains and hands-on experience with data science techniques

Responsibilities

We’re looking for engineers to build them from the ground up. Want to change the world with data and large-scale distributed systems? Do you want to solve challenges that you didn’t even know existed until you get to a large size? Come join us on the Azure Big data team! “Big data” is an acronym for collecting and processing massive data sets (viz., Petabyte scale) that is a becoming a well-established industry pattern. Apache Hadoop has become the industry standard for storing and computing on this data, and Microsoft is building Hadoop related services on Azure. CISL (Cloud and Information Services Lab) is deeply engaged with Microsoft’s Big Data teams (Cosmos, Hadoop). We are focused on several projects that build on the latest version of Hadoop/YARN and support analytics platforms such as Hive and Storm that are part of the Hadoop OSS ecosystem. Joining the CISL team is a fantastic opportunity to work with some of the best scientists/engineers in the industry who have had hands-on experience with managing Hadoop at scale. The group members have been involved with the Hadoop project for several years. Some of the software we build has already been released to the open source community. In particular, we built Rayon, a layer that adds resource reservation/planning and contributed the code back to Apache YARN. The CISL group has a strong bent towards innovation, tackling open problems, building novel solutions, and publishing papers. The team culture is results driven, and values collaboration and building robust shipping code. Efforts in the group range from developing novel ideas, to building prototypes for validation, to contributing code that runs in production settings, to publishing research papers in top conferences. As a Scientist in CISL, you will work with a talented team of scientists/engineers to design and develop Hadoop-related services on Azure. This is a great opportunity to learn YARN, HIVE, Storm, and other OSS technologies and contribute to the code base, while also leveraging Microsoft cloud technologies such as Azure. The systems you build will used to power some of our biggest internal customers (such as, Skype, Bing). We are looking for candidates with systems building skills with a bent towards doing publishable research.
